This p2p implementation relies on .Net WCF p2p protocol implementation. 
Some operation will be broadcasted to all the nodes in the mesh. 
Other operations will be dispatched only to some nodes. 

Read the IEventP2PService documentation to undertand it. 

This implementation can be replaced with a different P2P implementation.
