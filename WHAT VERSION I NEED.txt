denso is moving to different platforms very fast. 
in this folder you'll find many different implementation of densso for different platforms. 

I'm trying to keep all togheter and have a unique source code to maintain platform implementations aligned . 
But some platforms lacks features i need to develop denso, so you will find the full source only in the 
WINDOWS folder. 

What about other folders. 
WINDOWS PHONE folder and MONO folder contains solution with linked source, 
this mean that the REAL source code i use is the source code in WINDOWS folder, 
other folders contains only the differences i developed to maintain cross-platform compatibility.
